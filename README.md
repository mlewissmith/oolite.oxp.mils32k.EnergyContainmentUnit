# Energy Containment Unit OXP

Energy Containment Unit enhancements to
[Standard Equipment](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_Equipment)
- Temporary invulnerability to lasers
- Temporary forward weapon cooling

## Overview

This OXP provides equipment
- **Shield Boosters ECU**
- **Shield Boosters ECU License**
- **Forward Weapon ECU**
- **Forward Weapon ECU License**

An experienced pilot with a clean licence, who has earned enough money to buy
standard [Shield Boosters](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Shield_Boosters),
may also purchase an Energy Containment Unit addon. The **Shield Boosters ECU**
absorbs the energy of incoming laser fire and redistributes it to power the
shields. However, use of such equipment requires a licence and is a
one-time-only event, valid for one "flight" ie until next hyperspace jump or
next dock, after which the licence expires and must be re-purchased.

Similarly, the **Forward Weapon ECU** absorbs the heat energy of outgoing laser
fire and prevents the weapon from overheating. It applies only to the forward
weapon, and only to
[Pulse](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Pulse_Laser) /
[Beam](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Beam_Laser) /
[Mining](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Mining_Laser) /
[Military](https://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Military_Laser)
lasers. Again, in order to
purchase the ECU or license, the pilot must have a clean record, and the
activation is only valid until the next dock or jump.
